# Introduction
Traffic simulations are of immense importance for researchers as well as practitioners in the field of transportation. Eclipse SUMO provides a wide range of traffic planning and simulation applications. Eclipse SUMO is a toolsuite covering road network imports and enrichment, demand generation and assignment and a state-of-the-art microscopic traffic simulation capable to simulate private and public transport modes, as well as person-based trip chains. Being open source, Eclipse SUMO is ready to implement new behavioral models or to control the simulation remotely using various programming environments. These and other features make Eclipse SUMO one of the most often used open source traffic simulations with a large and international user community.

# Call for Papers
The conference aims on presenting new and unique results in the field of mobility simulation and modelling using openly available tools and data. We expect a large variety of research topics and usage approaches. If you are doing a research project fitting the topics below you are kindly invited to submit an abstract. Possible areas of interest include (but are not limited to):  

- Vehicular Communication
- Modelling Urban Mobility
- Intermodal Transport
- Autonomous Driving
- Logistics Simulation
- Mobility Modelling
- Traffic Simulation
- Traffic Applications
- Traffic Management Solutions
- Open Tools and Open Data
- E-Mobility

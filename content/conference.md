# Introduction
Traffic simulations are of immense importance for researchers as well as practitioners in the field of transportation. SUMO has been available since 2001 and provides a wide range of traffic planning and simulation applications. SUMO consists of a suite of tools covering road network imports and enrichment, demand generation and assignment, and a state-of-the-art microscopic traffic simulator capable of simulating private and public transport modes, as well as person-based trip chains. Being open source, SUMO is easily extensible by new behavioral models and can be dynamically controlled via a well-defined programming interface. These and other features make SUMO one of the most often used open source traffic simulators with a large and international user community.


# Call for Papers
The conference focuses on presenting new and unique results in the field of mobility simulation and modeling using openly available tools and data. We expect a large variety of research topics and usage approaches. If you are working on a research project fitting the topics below, you are kindly invited to submit an abstract. Possible areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Mobility and Demand Modelling
- Traffic Simulation
- Open Tools and Open Data
- Modelling Urban Mobility
- Traffic Applications

<div id="abmoreinfo" class="collapse">
A/B Street (<a href="https://abstreet.org">abstreet.org</a>) is an open source multi-modal traffic simulator designed for the general public to explore low-cost approaches for reducing motor vehicle use. Starting from OpenStreetMap data and a variety of travel demand sources, people using A/B Street can modify roads (like transforming street parking into bike- and bus-only lanes) and intersections (traffic signal timing). Using built-in elevation data, visualizations about individual trips and aggregate groups, and measurements of impact on travel time and risk exposure, interested citizens can present their idea to a city council for consideration.
<br><br>
This session will first give an overview of what A/B Street does and how it works. We'll then deep dive into understanding the discrete-event, agent-based simulation, and how to model dynamic lane-changing without compromising runtime performance. The second part of the session will be an interactive workshop where we install A/B Street (Mac, Windows, Linux, or running in your web browser), import somewhere new from OpenStreetMap, initially seed travel demand data, and start exploring adjustments to roads.

<h3><i>Ride-hailing and ride-pooling: State of the art, future research directions, and the role of traffic simulation</i></h3>

Already today, on-demand mobility services such as Uber and Lyft in the USA, and Didi in China have taken over a noticeable share of the modal split. Furthermore, the market value assessment of these companies is now higher than the one of established vehicle producers, as they are considered to have a very high potential despite current losses with regard to autonomous driving. With the elimination of driver costs, it is expected that ride-hailing and ride-pooling can be offered at a substantially lower cost than today, generating a significant increase in demand. To understand the impact of such automated on-demand systems on future transportation systems, simulations are needed to evaluate both fleet efficiency and their interaction with the overall transportation system.

<p><a id="moreinfobutton" style="color:#0645ad; cursor:pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('moreinfobutton').remove();" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#moreinfo">Read more <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></a></p>
<div id="moreinfo" class="collapse">
Studies to date have focused mainly on efficient vehicle-customer assignments and fleet strategies such as proactive repositioning in static networks. For example, a study comparing a current car-sharing operation with an autonomous ride-hailing system was able to show that although 10% empty trips were generated in the ride-hailing operation, it significantly increased fleet utilization. Additionally, it can be observed that system efficiency increases as fleet and demand scale. These positive scaling effects are even more prominent in ride-pooling systems. Larger demand and fleet increase pooling opportunities, which increases the occupancy rate and reduces additional fleet miles per trip request. In a simulation study for Munich, the evaluation of the trajectories of all fleet vehicles showed that these bundling potentials mainly occur on main arterial roads, while additional mileage is induced on secondary roads. These scaling effects in combination with low-cost operation can lead to a fundamental change in the established traffic system. To prevent undesirable effects on the overall system, regulations such as fleet limits, tolling, or public transport integration can help, but their tools still need to be understood in detail.
<br><br>
So far, the mutual effects of ride-hailing and ride-pooling as well as traffic flow have only been modeled in a simplified way. The effective coupling to microscopic traffic simulations like SUMO can be of great benefit here. Such simulation models are already valuable tools in studies on traffic control algorithms, up to the analysis of the effects of automated vehicles. In the context of ride-hailing and ride-pooling, these simulation models can additionally help to further understand traffic flow effects arising from the introduction of large-scale on-demand services. Corresponding impacts of such operations onto traffic states can then be modelled dynamically. Vice-versa, dynamic travel time estimations can be beneficial for the modelling of ride-hailing and ride-pooling operation. Furthermore, the impact of required empty trips due to repositioning or bundled passenger flows due to pooling in urban transportation networks is still poorly understood. In addition, microscopic simulations are needed to efficiently organize boarding and loading processes, detect bottlenecks, and identify any needed infrastructure at an early stage.

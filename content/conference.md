# Save the date!
SUMO User Conference 2022: May 09-11.

# Call for Papers
The conference focuses on presenting new and unique results in the field of mobility simulation and modelling using openly available tools and data. We expect a large variety of research topics and usage approaches. If you are working on a research project fitting the topics below, you are kindly invited to submit an abstract. Possible areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Mobility and Demand Modelling
- Traffic Simulation
- Open Tools and Open Data
- Modelling Urban Mobility
- Traffic Applications
- Traffic Management Solutions
- Intermodal Transport
- Autonomous Driving
- Logistics Simulation
- Vehicular Communication
- E-Mobility
- Reinforcement learning / Machine Learning

# Paper Submission
***Attention***: We changed our paper submission process. We are now offering two submission types:

1. Scientific Papers:
   - All accepted scientific papers must be presented at the conference.
   - Scientific papers will be reviewed by at least 2 reviewers.
   - All accepted scientific papers will be published in the SUMO proceedings.
   - Scientific papers must be submitted in LaTeX or Word format before midnight, Monday, ~~*February 14th, 2022*~~ **February 28th, 2022**.
   - Scientific papers should be between 5 and 20 pages long.   
  
2. Technical Presentations:

    - The SUMO conference gives the opportunity to present your topic during the poster session or an oral short presentation.
    - There is no need to write a scientific paper.
    - Possible technical presentations can be:
        - Results of Bachelor or Master theses
        - Live Demos
        - SUMO Use Cases
        - Project Presentations
        - Work in Progress which would benefit from the feedback of other SUMO users
    - Title and a short abstract (300 words) must be submitted until Monday, ~~*February 14th, 2022*~~ **February 28th, 2022**.

**Templates and instructions for authors** can be found here: https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors   
Technical Presentations do not require following a template, feel free to use your own style!

# TAPAS Workshop
The agent-based  demand model TAPAS is an open source development of DLR’s Institute for Transport Research. TAPAS simulated the mobility patterns of a virtual population of a modelled regions. Both the population as well as the activity places are represented individually. TAPAS distinguishes a large set of person groups, and different modes of transport. The mobility behavior of the population is determined using empirical daily mobility plans. The result is a list of daily activities for each person within the modeled area, including the starting location, the destination location, the begin of the ride and the ride’s duration as well as the chosen mode, among others. The result can be used as an input for the microscopic traffic flow simulation SUMO.

Within the talk, the functioning of TAPAS will be presented as well as different application scenarios, ranging from public transport pricing, installation of demand-responsive transport to air quality measures on city scale.
